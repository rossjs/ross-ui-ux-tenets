        <!-- Slide 1: Know your users, know their core goals, understand priorities -->
        <section>
          <h2>1. Know your users, know their core goals, understand priorities</h2>
          <p>If you don't know your users or their core goals, how can you design the right solution for them? Understanding what your main user group is and prioritizing their needs is key.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A confused detective with a magnifying glass looking for user needs."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 2: The path forward should always be clear -->
        <section>
          <h2>2. The path forward should always be clear</h2>
          <p>A user should never be unsure of how to proceed through your app. It should always be clear what core actions a user has available to them and those should incorporate language and symbology that reinforces what action will be taken.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A hiker standing at a clear, well-marked trail with signposts."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 3: Every action should have a clear reaction -->
        <section>
          <h2>3. Every action should have a clear reaction</h2>
          <p>It should always be clear to a user what action has taken place after they interact with the UI. Provide feedback to a user after they've clicked a “save” button to ensure they understand their action has been taken.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A scientist pressing a button and getting a clear result."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 4: Don't lie to your users or make optimistic updates in the UI -->
        <section>
          <h2>4. Don't lie to your users or make optimistic updates in the UI</h2>
          <p>Don't show that a value has been changed in the UI if the request to make the change has not actually succeeded yet. Show a loading spinner next to the input to indicate that something is still happening.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A person nervously watching a loading spinner."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 5: Provide clear feedback if there is an issue -->
        <section>
          <h2>5. Provide clear feedback if there is an issue</h2>
          <p>It should never be ambiguous or unclear why a user can't progress through your app. Provide helpful message on what fields need to be filled out if a user tries to progress without completing them.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A user looking at an error message on a computer screen with a magnifying glass."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 6: Block as little of the app as possible -->
        <section>
          <h2>6. Block as little of the app as possible</h2>
          <p>While it can be necessary to block parts of the app while a user is waiting for a response, it should be avoided as much as possible. Try to always keep as much of your app usable as you can.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A user trying to click on blocked buttons on a UI."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 7: Identify the main workflow of the app and remove all barriers to achieving that -->
        <section>
          <h2>7. Identify the main workflow of the app and remove all barriers to achieving that</h2>
          <p>The app should have a clean, clear, and intuitive UI/UX for achieving the main use case. Any advanced or lesser used options should be hidden away behind menus or alternate UI by default.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A person swiftly bypassing obstacles on a clearly marked path."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 8: Site tours or interactive tutorials are for complex apps and failed UI/UX -->
        <section>
          <h2>8. Site tours or interactive tutorials are for complex apps and failed UI/UX</h2>
          <p>If you have to create a tutorial for how to use your “simple” app, you've strayed from the path and need to reevaluate what the core goals/workflows are.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A frustrated user looking at a complex tutorial."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 9: More steps/clicks, more pain -->
        <section>
          <h2>9. More steps/clicks, more pain</h2>
          <p>The more steps you add to a user's workflow, the more irksome your app feels and the more likely a user will not realize they have to do something important. Automate or cut down the steps on a cumbersome process wherever possible.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A user overwhelmed by too many steps on a staircase."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 10: UNLESS, you're designing a product for a wide range of users -->
        <section>
          <h2>10. UNLESS, you're designing a product for a wide range of users</h2>
          <p>Then it may make sense to make a more general purpose tool that can fit the use cases for many different kinds of users. Being mindful of your user diversity can lead to inclusive design.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "Diverse group of users finding a common solution."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 11: Always get confirmation for destructive or critical actions -->
        <section>
          <h2>11. Always get confirmation for destructive or critical actions</h2>
          <p>If a user triggers an action where the result of that action cannot be undone, ALWAYS ask for confirmation before executing it.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A user about to press a big red button labeled 'Delete', but there's a pop-up asking 'Are you sure?'."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 12: Stand on the shoulders of giants (and steal from them) -->
        <section>
          <h2>12. Stand on the shoulders of giants (and steal from them)</h2>
          <p>The best artists steal from others! It's an inescapable fact that creative expression is, in many ways, just the process of experiencing enough to be able to take pieces of those experiences and combine them to create something new.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "An artist sneakily borrowing elements from different artworks to create a new masterpiece."</i>
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 13: Don't try and innovate (unless you've got a damned good reason to) -->
        <section>
          <h2>13. Don't try and innovate (unless you've got a damned good reason to)</h2>
          <p>Don't try and reinvent the wheel when it comes to design. A large part of UI/UX design is making something look nice but also feel familiar.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Image prompt: "A user struggling with an 'innovative' wheel design that's not round."</i>
          </p>
