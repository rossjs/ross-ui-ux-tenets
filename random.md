Of course, here are some alternate funny meme-style Midjourney prompts, all themed around user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design:

1. **Identify your user** - "A detective zooming in on a computer screen with a user icon, magnifying glass in hand."
   
2. **Identify your user’s goals** - "A user icon in superhero cape, with goals written on power bars soaring into the sky."
   
3. **Identify distractions and remove them** - "A user at a computer with pop-ups like little monsters, using a broom to sweep them away."
   
4. **Anticipate user needs and meet them where they are** - "A user traveling on a path with the app UI elements popping up from the ground just in time to help."
   
5. **Create an intuitive system, then test it out** - "A maze shaped like a mobile app with a user at the start and the 'goal' at the end."
   
6. **Make the app UI simple enough that any new user can easily understand it** - "A caveman happily using a modern app, with a 'so simple, a caveman can do it' caption."
   
7. **Identify the main workflow of the app and remove all barriers to achieving that** - "A user running on a racetrack in the shape of an app with hurdles labeled as barriers being removed by a big broom."
   
8. **Site tours or interactive tutorials are for complex apps and failed UI/UX** - "A user lost in a jungle with a signboard pointing to different app features. A thought bubble shows the user wishing for a simpler way."
   
9. **More steps/clicks, more pain** - "A user climbing a mountain made of mouse clicks, sweating and looking tired."
   
10. **UNLESS, you’re designing a product for a wide range of users** - "A bunch of diverse user icons happily using the same Swiss Army knife-like app, each in their own way."
   
11. **Always get confirmation for destructive or critical actions** - "A user about to step on a 'Delete' landmine, with a pop-up shield labeled 'Confirmation' appearing in front of it."
   
12. **Stand on the shoulders of giants (and steal from them)** - "A small designer icon on the shoulder of a giant user, using a fishing rod to catch good UI/UX ideas from the giant's head."
   
13. **Don’t try and innovate (unless you’ve got a damned good reason to)** - "A user on a square wheel bicycle with a frustrated face, passing by another user cruising smoothly on a regular bike, with a caption 'if it ain't broke...'".






Here are some meme-style midjourney prompts for each section:

## 1. Know your users, know their core goals, understand priorities

"When you try to please everyone but end up pleasing no one. #UIUXMishap"

## 2. The path forward should always be clear

"When your app's UI is more confusing than IKEA instructions. #ClarityIsKey"

## 3. Every action should have a clear reaction

"When the user hits 'save' and waits for an eternity. Was it saved? The suspense is real. #ClearFeedback"

## 4. Don’t lie to your users or make optimistic updates in the UI

"Remember when the app said it saved your changes, but it didn't? Good times. #HonestyIsTheBestPolicy"

## 5. Provide clear feedback if there is an issue

"When the error message is as helpful as 'An error occurred.' Thanks, Captain Obvious. #ClearErrorMessages"

## 6. Block as little of the app as possible

"Loading...still loading...still...still...Oh look, it's tomorrow already! #ProgressiveLoadingFTW"

## 7. Identify the main workflow of the app and remove all barriers to achieving that

"When finding the 'logout' button becomes the final level of your app game. #KeepItSimpleSilly"

## 8. Site tours or interactive tutorials are for complex apps and failed UI/UX

"'Click here for tutorial' feels like the 'Dora the Explorer' of apps. #FailUX"

## 9. More steps/clicks, more pain

"Click here, now there, now back here...Oh, we are not playing hide and seek? #CutTheClicks"

## 10. UNLESS, you’re designing a product for a wide range of users

"When designing for everyone makes you feel like a DJ taking song requests at a party. #GeneralPurposeTool"

## 11. Always get confirmation for destructive or critical actions

"When 'delete forever' really means forever and there's no 'ctrl + z'. #ConfirmDestructiveAction"

## 12. Stand on the shoulders of giants (and steal from them)

"Copying your homework but changing it enough so it doesn't look copied. #StealLikeAnArtist"

## 13. Don’t try and innovate (unless you’ve got a damned good reason to)

"When the new feature turns out to be as useful as a chocolate teapot. #InnovationFail"
